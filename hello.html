    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p><font size="3">Hello world! My name is Sharice and I am the owner and desinger of Lady Lynelle Custom Creations LLC. I started this company with the idea of creating anything and everything that I possibly can. Ironically, it started out with Web design! Since I didn't have the paitence to be a cook, computers was the thing for me.</p>
        <p>I have branched out to different customizing designs from others and then started designing for myself since I could not find the design I wanted for my wedding. Since then, I have made tote bags, invitations, business cards, websites and so mmuch more for others.</p>
        <p>I really enjoy creating things from a blank "canvas"(so to speak) and seeing how it transform from nothing into something great.
